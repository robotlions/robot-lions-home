# Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e Character Generator

This project, written in Next JS with React, uses tables from the 2003 release of the Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook to generate D&D characters.

Users have three character-creation options: standard, quick or custom. Standard mode allows rolling up a first-level character in accordance with the Player's Handbook. Quick mode creates a semi-randomized character based on a race, class and aligment. And custom allows the user to manually set the level and abilty scores and also starts the character with a million silver.

Created characters can then be printed or exported as PDFs.

The app is styled in Tailwind CSS and is mobile-responsive.
